# Next Plugins

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/evantahler/next-plugins/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

An example of how to use a dynamic import to load a page from a random plugin outside of the main next "pages" directory

- `server` is the root project
- `plugins` contains the plugins with additional pages and components we want to display in the main application

To Start:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
